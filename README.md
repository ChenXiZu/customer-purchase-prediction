# customer-purchase-prediction
Predicting repeat customers using Python, scikit-learn, and a real-world retail dataset.
##  Overview

This project explores customer behavior using transaction data and applies machine learning to classify whether a customer is likely to return. We used logistic regression and random forest models, with class balancing techniques to improve fairness and accuracy.

##  Techniques Used

- Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
- Logistic Regression (baseline)
- Random Forest Classifier
- Feature Importance Analysis
- Class Balancing (undersampling)
- Evaluation with Confusion Matrix & Classification Report

---

##  Key Features Used

- Quantity
- Unit Price
- Total Price (engineered feature)

---

##  Results

- Random forest outperformed logistic regression in most metrics
- After balancing, macro F1-score improved significantly
- Total spending was the most important predictor
